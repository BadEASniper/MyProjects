# ARMS RACE
I did this project for my university in 2019 and it is about The Cold War.
You can check out the .ppt  presentation or the .docx documentaion about it,
however it's all in german beacuse I'm at the german section. 

It's  about diferential equations, and the math is a bit complicated,
but to sum it up breefly, the mathematic model the python script is based on,
predicts the economic growth of 2 neighboured countries that are in an arms race.

The to sets of diagrams that the script generates, picture how the economy of each side 
evolves over 100 years and how the safety of each country is affected by the other one 
arming up.
